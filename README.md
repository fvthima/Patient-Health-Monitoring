# Real-Time Patient Health Monitoring using Hidden Markov Models (HMM)

## Overview
This project involves the development of a real-time patient health monitoring system using Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The system is designed to track patient health metrics and identify potential health issues in real-time.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**:
   - The system collects real-time data from various health monitoring devices.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The collected data is preprocessed to remove noise and handle missing values.

3. **Modeling with Hidden Markov Models (HMM)**:
   - HMM is used to model the sequence of health states and predict potential health issues.

## How to Run the Project
### Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Required Python packages installed. You can install necessary packages by running:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
